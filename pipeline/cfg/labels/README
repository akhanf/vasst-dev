## HarvardOxford-combined

The HarvardOxford-combined atlas is a customized atlas created from the lateralized cortical (cortl) and subcortical (subcort) labels of the atlas provided in FSL5.0. The label numbers were created in house by adding first a background label, then the subcortical labels (minus the bilateral GM + WM labels), then the lateralized cortical labels for a total of 114 labels. All labels are bilateral except for the brainstem and background.

HarvardOxford-combined-NetworkLabelList.csv: the standard for pipeline analysis
HarvardOxford-combined-NetworkLabelList_full.csv: has the filenames for mask and time series files for ease of processing mat files
HarvardOxford-combined-NetworkLabelList_fullname.csv: has the full human text descriptor for each anatomical region; but since bash doesn't have good csv support excluded fullnames with spaces for now
HarvardOxford-combined-NetworkLabelList_fconn.csv: has the ventricles removed and is ordered based on left/right hemisphere and further into subcortical/cortical; maintains correspondence between HarvardOxford and fconn/matlab worlds.
