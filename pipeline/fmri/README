Introduction
------------

Using a legend for FreeSurfer labels originally available at: /home/alik/epilepsy/local_data/fMRI/scripts/NetworkLabelLists/NetworkLabelList.csv but copied locally here (should be put into repository)

Scripts here with order of use (may be renamed at some point):
(TODO: before that the prestat work in FSL)
1. extractTimeSeries_FMRI
2. computeCorrelationMatrix_FMRI which calls getConnectivitySubj.m
  * getConnectivitySubj.m is placed in repository/tools/matlab and has a hard-coded path for now

extractTimeSeries_FMRI
----------------------

- dependency: FreeSurfer automatic segmentation
- extract individual segmented label files and mean fMRI time series for a given subject based on ROIs from FreeSurfer segmentation (can enter multiple subjects at the command-line)

computeCorrelationMatrix_FMRI
-----------------------------

- dependency: extractTimeSeries_FMRI
- compute correlation matrix from time series for further graph analysis
- also creates subject-specific csv file with CoG and volume of each label
- also creates numeric correspondence between matrix (1..N) and FreeSurfer labels (whatever FreeSurfer usually uses)
